### Design

### Key Features

### Technologies
* Authentication: An input for your user to create an account and login. You will want to display the user's name after they login.
* Database data: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Simon, this is the high scores of all players.
* WebSocket data: A rendering of data that is received from your server. This may be realtime data sent from other users (e.g. chat or scoring data), or realtime data that your service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores). For Simon, this represents every time another user creates or ends a game
