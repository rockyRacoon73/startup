## Startup Specification
(name still in development)

### Elevator Pitch
Would you like to share your enthusiasm for a particular choice of media with your friends? Want to know what people are saying about the latest novels, albums, or movies? The media rating application allows you to read and publish reviews so you can hear opinions on the latest media. You can also save your favorite reviews so you can revisit them after your next viewing/listening/reading experience. And, if you are worried about forgetting all of the wonderful media choices that you have seen reviews for, you can add these media releases to a list so you can remember what books, movies, or albums, you wanted to visit.
