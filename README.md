## Startup Specification
(name still in development)

### Elevator Pitch
Would you like to share your enthusiasm for a particular choice of media with your friends? Want to know what people are saying about the latest novels, albums, or movies? The media rating application allows you to read and publish reviews so you can hear opinions on the latest media. You can also save your favorite reviews so you can revisit them after your next viewing/listening/reading experience. And, if you are worried about forgetting all of the wonderful media choices that you have seen reviews for, you can add these media releases to a list so you can remember what books, movies, or albums, you wanted to visit.

### Technologies
* Authentication: An input for your user to create an account and login. You will want to display the user's name after they login.
* Database data: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Simon, this is the high scores of all players.
* WebSocket data: A rendering of data that is received from your server. This may be realtime data sent from other users (e.g. chat or scoring data), or realtime data that your service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores). For Simon, this represents every time another user creates or ends a game
