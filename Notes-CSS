# Cascading Style Sheets

css is primarily concerned with defining rules

```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```

A ruleset for each selector: selector `p` selects all paragraph elements in HTML document
4 declarations changing properties to some value


## Associating CSS with HTML
3 ways:
1. use `style` att in HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations
  `<p style="color:green">CSS</p>`
2. use style element to define css rules within HTML. Shoud appear in head of the document so applies to all
```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```
3. use html `link` element to create ref to external css rule file. must be in `head`
'<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />'

## Cascading styles
sometimes html elements inherit rules from  parents
```
<body>
  <p><span style="color:black">CSS</span></p>
</body>
```

```
body {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
span {
  color: blue;
}
```

cascade down from highest nodes to lowest level. lower levls overide
test with inspect on chrome

## box model
CSS defiens everything as boxes
* innermost box - text or image
* padding 
* border 
* margin (white space)

default width and height of an element is width and height of content box
By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and 
height of the content box. You can change the box-sizing CSS property from
the default value of content-box to border-box in order to redefine the width
and height to also include the padding and the border. This often makes it
easier to style elements when their visual size matches their actual size.
